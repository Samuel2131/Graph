# Graph
### This project allows you to save strings in an oriented graph data structure, it also contains a double-linked list indexed to contain graph nodes.
## Functionality
* Add graph vertex function;
* Add graph arch function;
* Update graph vertex;
* Delete graph vertex;
### To obtain the number of links of a vertex the adjacency list is used, to check if 2 vertices are connected the adjacency matrix is used;
## Functionality
* getNumArch function for the number of vertex;
* isConnected function for to check if 2 vertices are connected;
### There are also functions to print all the vertices of the graph, and the adjacency matrix
## Functionality
* printGraph function to print all graph nodes with all vertex addresses linked;
* printValueGraph function to print only graph values;
* printAdjMatrix function to print adjacency matrix;
* printAdjMatrixWithoutNodes to print adjacency matrix without the name of vertex;
